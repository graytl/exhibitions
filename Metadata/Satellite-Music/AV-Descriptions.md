## A/V Descriptions

_Below are descriptions for audio-visual clips requested by the curators for the upcoming satellite exhibition held in 
Ingram Hall of the Blair School of Music on the history of recorded sound. Text is not yet finalized and is subject to further editing._

#### Clip 1 | The Edison Phonograph Cylinder 
Developed by Thomas Edison and introduced to the market in 1889, phonograph cylinders were the first commercial medium for recorded sound. The standard cylinder was a hollow tube of wax that could record approximately two minutes of music. This recording of Ignazio Cesari’s performance from Verdi’s Simon Boccanegra (1912-13) was one of hundreds of cylinders made during Edison’s attempt to identify and recruit European talent for his company.
#### Clip 2 | The Victor Talking Machine Company
Founded in 1901, the Victor Talking Machine Company was largely responsible for the transition away from the cylinder to the 78 rpm sound recording. Victor employed shrewd marketing techniques for its acoustic 78s, signing the biggest stars to exclusive contracts and using the now famous dog Nipper as part of its distinctive branding. This recording features the great tenor Enrico Caruso, whose series of recordings for Victor cemented the popularity of the Victrola.

#### Clip 3 | The Rise of the Compact Disc
* Description: While the LP and cassette tape remained the predominant consumer formats through the 1980s, the adoption of 
the compact disc by recording companies led to a revolution for the industry. Record executives and retailers were delighted 
by the surge in CD sales, spurred in large part by consumers repurchasing older albums in this new format. By 2007, 200 
billion CDs had been sold worldwide.

#### Clip 4 | Game Changer: The mp3
* Description: The CD was a cash cow for the recording industry, but advances in computing and the internet gave rise to an 
entirely new format for music in the late 1990s: the mp3. Users could suddenly convert their CDs to mp3s, upload their music 
to file sharing programs, and download digital music files put up by other users. The record industry was completely 
unprepared for this development, leaving them to play catch up while fighting a rearguard action against music piracy.

#### Clip 5 | Online Music Goes Legal: The iPod
* Description: The mp3 format proved wildly popular with the public, but with few options for purchasing mp3s legally, music 
piracy threatened to destroy the industry. The introduction of Apple’s iTunes Store and original iPod in 2001 was a game 
changer. Consumers could legally purchase individual tracks of music for as little as $0.99, and the sleek design and 
friendly user interface of the iPod made for a blockbuster combination. The launch of the iPod Mini in 2004 was a sensation, 
and Apple continues to be known for its ability to generate massive public interest in its product launches.

#### Clip 6 | Vinyl Makes a Comeback
* Description: While digital music formats will continue to be dominant, vinyl sound recordings are enjoying a Renaissance. 
A number of classic albums, including the complete Beatles catalog, have been reissued on vinyl in recent years. As the home 
of United Record Pressing, Nashville plays a role in the resurgence of vinyl. Owned by Jack White, United has pressed records
for many current artists, including Adele, Radiohead, Kanye West, Kings of Leon, and The Roots.
