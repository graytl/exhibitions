##3D Model of Central Library

Anjelica Saulsberry, a senior at Vanderbilt University, created this 3D model of the Vanderbilt University Central Library during her Library Dean's Fellowship in 2015. She initially built the structure in the [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) game environment. With assistance from the library's GIS specialist, she generated a 3D model using open source 3D modeling source tools [Mineways](http://www.realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/mineways/) and [Meshlab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/). Finally, [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/), a 3D printing service, printed the model and delivered it for this exhibit. The production of this model demonstrates how a digital object originally generated by computer code can wind up having an afterlife as a physical object.
