## Visualizing data
#### Pedestal case: 3D Modeling the Cumberland

Many new ways of visualizing the world we live in have emerged in the last century.  Once way of visualizing data which is especially interesting is by 3D modeling.  Elevation data can be converted to a 3D model and sent to a printer.  Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) was used to collect elevation data in Davidson County, Tennessee in 2010 after the May flood of 2010.  This data was converted to a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and then converted once more into a printable 3D format.  The larger 3D print exhibits a lower resolution, large scale view of the Nashville area, while the smaller print is a lower scale and higher resolution view of the downtown area.
