#### Inset case: Mapping the Cumberland

At the end of the eighteenth century, the maps available for the territories around the Cumberland River and the Tennessee River were still not as accurate as the ones that were published twenty years later.
Methods in mapping, engineering, geologic processes and catastrophic flood events have all impacted the landscape of the Cumberland.  This exhibit explores changes and history of the Cumberland from 1792 through today.
