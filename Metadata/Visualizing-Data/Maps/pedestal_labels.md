## Visualizing data
#### Pedestal: 3D Visualizations of the Cumberland through Nashville

Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) was used to collect elevation data in Davidson County, Tennessee in 2010 after the May flood of 2010.  This data was converted to a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and then converted once more into a printable 3D format.  The larger 3D print exhibits a lower resolution, large scale view of the Nashville area, while the smaller print is a lower scale and higher resolution view of the downtown area.


1) Large scale 3D print of Nashville, TN.

2) Small scale 3D print centered over the Capitol, Nashville, TN.

3) Background imagery

4) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) used to convert to 3D print, shown in color scale ranging from low elevation in dark colors to high elevation in light colors.
