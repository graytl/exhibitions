            <description>The Cumberland River flooded again in January of 1937. This view overlooks North First Street. Traffic was hampered by the water, which was at a flood stage of 44.7' that day. Note the man at left rifing his bicycle across the bridge. The water took weeks to subside, and as a result of the disaster, Kentucky Dam and Lake were built as flood control measures. </description>
