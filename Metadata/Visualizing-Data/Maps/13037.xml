      <description>The Cumberland River flooded again in January of 1937, a record flood year for the Cumberland, Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers that has been described as the worst disaster in American history to that date. Snow, sleet and over 21 inches of freezing rain in January caused flood waters to inundate areas that had never before seen floods. Governor Gordon Browning called out the National Guard who worked in tandem with the Red Cross to house and feed displaced residents at the height of the Depression. This view overlooks portions of 7th and 8th Avenue North.</description>
