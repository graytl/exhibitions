upcoming exhibition held in the Peabody Library. Text is not yet finalized and is subject to further editing._

* Image Title | Mei Li
  * Filename: PC-Mei_Li-Handforth-1938-01.jpg
  * Mei Li, honored as one of the first Caldecott winners, tells the story of a young Chinese girl out to prove to her brother 
  that anything he can do, she can do better.  Thomas Handforth's work at the time challenged not only traditional gender roles,   but introduced readers to a culture many were previously unfamiliar with.
* Image Title | Marisol McDonald Doesn't Match
  * Filename: PC-Marisol_McDonald_Doesn't_Match-Brown-2011.jpg
  * Marisol McDonald is no ordinary girl.  She has brown skin, red hair, and is a soccer-playing pirate- princess.  As a       biracial child with a diverse group of friend, Marisol is truly a modern day American kid.
* Image Title | Japanese Tales and Legends
  * Filename: PC-Japanese_Tales_and_Legends-McAlpine-1959-01.jpg; PC-Japanese_Tales_and_Legends-McAlpine-1959-01.jpg
  * Joan Kiddell-Monroe's beautiful illustrations accompany a collection of Japanese folktales compiled and translated by Helen and William McAlpine for Oxford University Press. Kiddell-Monroe's illustrations emulate the style and technique of traditional Japanese art.
* Image Title | Henry's Freedom Box
  * Filename: PC-Henry's_Freedom_Box-Levine_Nelson-2007.jpg
  * The depiction of slavery in children's literature evolved throughout the 20th century. In Henry's Freedom Box, Henry, a southern slave, enlists the help of a White abolitionist, Dr. Smith, to help him reach freedom in the North.
* Image Title | Pedro, the Angel of Olvera Street
  * Filename: PC-Pedro_El_Angel_de_la_Calle_Olvera-1961.jpg
  * Inspired by the residents of downtown Los Angeles, Leo Politi created the character of Pedro, the Angel of Olvera Street.  Politi's book portrays the Mexican American culture which influenced his own development as an artist.
* Image Title | Muhammad
  * Filename: PC-Muhammad-Demi-2003-A.jpg; PC-Muhammad-Demi-2003-B.jpg
  * Unlike the depiction of Jesus Christ, a figure portrayed frequently in children's literature, this is the first time the Prophet Muhammad has been depicted in a children's book.  Respecting the Islamic tradition of never portraying the prophet with a body and face, Demi shares the story of Muhammad in a manner that is both informative and respectful.
* Image Title | Black and White: a Song that is a Story about Freedom to Go to School Together
  * Filenames: PC-Black_and_White-Arkin-1956-01-A.jpg; PC-Black_and_White-Arkin-1956-01-B.jpg; PC-Black_and_White-Arkin-1956-02.jpg; PC-Black_and_White-Arkin-1956-03-A.jpg; PC-Black_and_White-Arkin-1956-03-B.jpg; PC-Black_and_White-Arkin-1956-04.jpg
  * Musician David Arkin wrote the song "Black &amp; White" in response to the Supreme Court's ruling in the Brown vs. Board of Education case.  Ten years later, Arkin published a children's book combining his original lyrics with powerful illustrations to depict the effect this ruling had on American society.
* Image Title | The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
  * Filenames: PC-The_Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn-1933-01.jpg; PC-The_Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn-1933-02.jpg; PC-The_Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn-1933-03.jpg; PC-The_Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn-1933-04.jpg
  * One of the most revered and controversial novels in American literature, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn tells the exploits of young Huck Finn and his companion Jim. Most of the controversy related to the novel revolves around the issue of race.  As depicted in E.W. Kemble's drawings from this 1904 version of the novel, Jim is portrayed in a foolish manner, reminiscent of a minstrel show character.
