## Firesign to VRA Core mapping

This mapping is intended to aid in the process of copying/pasting VRA Core data into Firesign for the 2015 exhibits.

Example metadata in the table below comes from \Metadata\1941\The_Holy_Bible-1613.xml.

Robert Barker, the King's Printer, first published the book in 1611; this edition contains printing errors that were eventually eliminated in a later edition of 1613. This folio depicts the offspring of Adam and Eve as a tree form, with text, "As by one manâ€™s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many also be made righteous." |

#### Questions
* Rights (rightsSet in VRA) and Subjects (subjectSet in VRA) have not been input into Firesign in the past. Will they be now? *No, we will likely continue to keep Firesign simple and not add these fields.*
* Do we need to do any further cleanup on any of the fields to aid in copy/paste?
    - invert agent names to Firstname Lastname (from Lastname, Firstname) -- maybe?
    - ~~names with birth/death dates~~ 
    - ~~dates in different formats~~ 
    - [done 6/25/15 jg] capitalize first word of all Format entries
    - ~~remove call numbers from Donor entries~~ 
    - [done 6/25/15 jg] add Creation Date field and relabel current date field to Publication Date (so that both dates are available to choose from)
    - [done 6/25/15 jg] add Image Filename field
    - [done--none found 6/25/15 jg] check for other VRA fields that might state the manuscript collection/source and add the field(s) if applicable
