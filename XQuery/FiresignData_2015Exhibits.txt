(Elijah Hinsdale), 1794-1838	1833	-	Astronomical charts	Sevier Oversize Collection, QB65 .B87 1833	Vanderbilt University Special Collections	Public Domain	The 18th and 19th century saw an exponential growth in the number of identified stars due to technological improvements. From ancient times until around 1600, the number of identified stars remained at around 1000. But by 1800, scientists had identified over 100,000 stars. American mathematician and astronomer Elijah Burritt published his atlas as a poor man's substitute for a celestial globe. Designed for teaching astronomy, the atlas illustrated stars visible to the naked eye.

Bandy Center for Baudelaire Studies, Morris Wachs Collection, AE25 .E555 1751a	W.T. Bandy Center for Baudelaire Studies	Public Domain	Denis Diderot, a key figure in the advancement of Enlightenment philosophy, envisioned the project of the Encyclopedie with his collaborator Jean D’Alembert. The prospectus was accompanied by a diagram of the “Map of Human Knowledge” which Diderot described as "the Genealogical Tree of All the Arts and Sciences." The Systême figuré groups all learning under memory (history), reason (philosophy) or imagination (poetry). God, as the source of knowledge, is conspicuously absent.

His research led to his hypothesis that lands bordering the Atlantic Ocean were once joined. Here, Humboldt delineates the longitude and latitudes of Mexican villages, research which led to new discoveries in the origins of atmospheric disturbances.
1941		Grand_Plan_de_Paris-Taride-1675.jpg	Grand_Plan_de_Paris-Taride-1675.xml	Paris vers 1675: Grand Plan de Paris et de Ses Environs, Grand Plan de Paris et de Ses Environs	Jouvin de Rochefort, Albert, fl. 1672, Bonnardot, Alfred, Taride, A.	1675	1530	Historical maps	Sevier Oversize Collection, G5834 .P3 1675 .J6	Vanderbilt University Special Collections	Public Domain	This 1530 map of Paris depicts key edifices of the French capital and its distinctive topographic features. Printer and cartographer Albert Jouvin Rochefort (c. 1540- c. 1710) included the map in his nine-panel 1672 district map of Paris. Rochefort's map expands on Arnoullet's, particularly in the growing urban center of Paris, where speculators were hoping to build large hotels that the narrow streets of the old city could not accommodate.
1941		Histoire_Naturelle-1873.jpg	Histoire_Naturelle-1873.xml	Histoire Naturelle: Générale et Particulière	Buffon, Georges Louis Leclerc, comte de, 1707-1788, Dufart, François, 1748-	1800	-	Encyclopedias	Science and Engineering Library, 570 B92h, Volume 23	Sarah Shannon Stevenson Science & Engineering Library	Public Domain	Buffon's Histoire Naturelle was an undertaking on the scale of Diderot and D'Alembert's Encyclopedie. In this “Table of the Order of Dogs," Buffon presents his definition of species (against that of Linnaeus!) as beings defined by time, environment, and interaction with people—instead of by God’s eternal plan. From the dogs at the center top of the chart, we move both forward in time and to more temperate climates where species of dog are perfected according to their relationship with mankind.

Books of hours	Nettie Hale Rand Collection of Fine Bindings and Printing, BX2080 .C37 1503	Vanderbilt University Special Collections	Public Domain	This printed book of hours offered the owner not just a cycle of prayers but medical advice as well, including when to be bled. Zodiacal Man’s midsection indicates which planets rule which parts of the body: Jupiter affects his liver, the moon his head, and so on. The smaller figures at the corners are types of the four humors. Doctors as far back as Hippocrates knew that an imbalance of the body’s four fluids, known as humors, resulted in distortions of health and character.

It was then that English natural philosopher Robert Hooke began an extended set of experiments with the microscope on plants, insects and combustion and respiration. The large plates in his Micrographia, created with the support of architect Christopher Wren, confirmed the value of the microscope for discovering natural worlds previously invisible to the human eye.

The Earth forms the center (with an inverted landscape), followed by spheres of water, air and fire, the seven known planets, the firmament and its crystal ceiling and the prime moving force. The ethereal world follows in a crescent containing God and the celestial beings. The geocentric view of the universe would be supplanted by Nicolas Copernicus, who proved the sun was the center of the universe in 1530.
1941		Phytologia-Darwin-1800.jpg	Phytologia-Darwin-1800.xml	Phytologia: Or, the Philosophy of Agriculture and Gardening	Darwin, Erasmus, 1731-1802	1800	-	Books	Science and Engineering Library, Annex, 580 D22p	Sarah Shannon Stevenson Science & Engineering Library	Public Domain	Erasmus Darwin was a British physician, scientist, inventor and poet who originated the ideas of natural selection and photosynthesis. He published Zoonomia after 20 years of remaining silent due to public censure. His grandson Charles would further these ideas in On the Origin of Species. Phytologia, a seminal book on plant science, detailed photosynthesis and identified essential plant nutrients. His final book traced the evolution of life from the microscopic to humankind.

His Principia Philosophiae, first published in 1644, put forth the theory that the universe operated as a continuously running machine which God had set in motion. The universe, which has no vacuum, was composed of a 'subtle matter' he named 'tourbillons,' which swirled in vortices like whirlpools and actually moved the planets by contact.

Most DNA forms two strands that wrap around each other to form a double helix. James Watson and Francis Crick were awarded a Nobel Prize for their proposed design of the double helix in 1953, based on the photography of Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling.
1941		Systema_Naturae-Linne-1788.jpg	Systema_Naturae-Linne-1788.xml	Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae	Linné, Carl von, 1707-1778, Gmelin, Johann Friedrich, 1748-1804, G.E. Beer	1788	-	Books	Sevier Collection, QH43 .C53 1788	Vanderbilt University Special Collections	Public Domain	Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus identified the three kingdoms of nature (stones, plants and animals) in his Systema Naturae (1735). Each kingdom was subdivided into classes, orders, genera, species, and varieties. Linnaeus identified six classes of animals, including mammalia, a term he coined that referred to animals that suckled. For Linnaeus, the naming and classifying of living beings was the key to all knowledge, especially the knowledge of God's plan for the world.

After Manson's arrest and 1971 conviction for the Tate/LaBianca murders, Fromme continued to represent Manson and deliver messages from him to his followers and keep his name alive in the press. She was trying to write a history of the Manson family using scrapbooks she created from letters, photographs and news clippings. No manuscript was ever found.

Lynette Fromme (1948- ) fielded these requests for information and vetted offers from publishing houses to the rights of the true history of the group. Writing in coded language, she warns a potential biographer to stick to the true story of Manson and not give in to the media hype surrounding him and his followers.

Stahlman Historical Autograph Collection, Lynette Fromme	Vanderbilt University Special Collections	Copyright held by Time Magazine	Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme made the cover of Time for her attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford on September 5, 1975. Feminist leaders across the country reacted to the magazine’s use of the word “Girl” to describe Fromme, who was twenty-seven at the time, asking if they would have used “Boy” if Fromme had been male. For a short time she transformed from Charles Manson acolyte, would be assassin, to feminist cause célèbre.

Newspapers of the day splashed the front pages with images of Fromme, Secret Service agents and the president. The Washington Star’s September 6, 1975, coverage of the startling event is typical of what front pages all over the country looked like the day after the attempted assassination.

Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald. Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme was the first woman to attempt an assassination of an American president. Interestingly, only seventeen days later, while leaving a hotel in San Fransisco, California, another attempt was made on Ford’s life by Sara Jane Moore, who actually fired off a round at the president.

Conducted on the cusp of the Great Depression and the rise of underworld crime, the flight was a shining moment for a country that was quickly heading into darkness. When the pilot's baby was kidnapped in 1932, many Americans questioned how something so heinous could happy to their hero.  Surely, if it could happen to Lindy, it could also happen to them.

Van Stavoren's Nashville photography studio as a nine-year-old. He had to keep this solar camera, designed to make life-sized enlargements on silvered paper from negatives, directed on the sun to avoid setting fire to nearby buildings. This meant spending hours awake on the roof in all weather. The poor quality of the paper, which was difficult to obtain in Nashville during early Reconstruction, required the immense lens to produce an intense solar beam.

Henderson and other railroad executives, attendance was low due to an outbreak of yellow fever across the Gulf States. Like San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts, Nashville's Parthenon was recreated in the 1920s. Souvenirs like these circulated widely in the United States after expositions in Philadelphia (1876) and in Chicago (1893).

This young woman, posing for her portrait, wears her corset laced to an uncommonly small size. Although corsets are mythologized as sex objects today, in the 19th century, corsets were worn by all women who wanted their body shape to conform to the current style. By the 1880s, small round waists were equated with good breeding and gentility.

While we do not know much about Elizabeth's caretaker Ida, we can see the affectionate gesture of the little girl. Elizabeth, the only child of James Kirkland, was born in 1898. In 1919, she graduated from Wellesley College. She married Benjamin D. Meritt soon after; the couple lived in New Jersey where Meritt taught at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study.

She graduated from the Knoxville Female Academy and married William Henderson in November 1866. Harriet’s fashionable dress dates this image to the early 1860s. She may have intended her portrait for William to carry with him while he fought in the war. The Hendersons were married 55 years. Their daughters Mary and Anna, born in 1867 and 1869, trained in Boston and Berlin to become accomplished musicians.

While some players wore fine wool clothes called tuxedo suits, others dressed more casually like Mary Henderson, Robert Clark and their friends. One fan described tennis parties as “the highlight of society.” First played in Nahant, MA, in 1874, tennis gained players quickly with 33 clubs in play by 1881. Mary Henderson attended Boston’s Gannett Boarding School for two years after graduating from Knoxville High School.

Photographers could capture emotions easily with shorter exposure times with Kodak film cameras introduced in 1888. The subsequent craze for smiling images taken outdoors can be summed up in relaxed images like this one of Mary Henderson, circa 1910, on her holiday abroad. Just as we snap and share selfies today, our great-grandparents took huge numbers of photos, made albums and sent their favorites to friends and family.

He described the palace as “empty of nearly all portable articles” after the looting by Allied troops and missionaries. Ricalton wanted armchair travelers to experience "the very same feelings [in Peking]" as he had. He described two states of reality viewers would experience; the reality of the physical world and an altered state of consciousness or "soul life."

Jackson Collection	Vanderbilt University Special Collections	Public Domain	The transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway and the great hotels the firm built changed how people saw the mountains. Once considered a barrier to progress, the mountains were now viewed by many as a major tourist attraction. Canadian Pacific Railway’s Glacier House Hotel opened near the glacier’s terminus in 1885. The mountains were widely promoted after Glacier National Park opened in 1886 by Swiss guides working at the hotel and in exhibits and books. The glacier’s name means “big water” in the Okangan language.

Paris was the place to study theology in the Middle Ages. This leaf is from a fine Paris Bible that was used by a succession of readers, some of whom added tiny, precisely written notes that have faded to pale tan but are still visible in the margins. This is a correction by a later owner, who supplied a line the original scribe carelessly skipped over.

The initial V for the opening words of the book, “Visio Isaiae” (“The vision of Isaiah. . .”), introduces the prophet’s long and impassioned rebuke to the people of Israel for their sins. The small scene inside the initial V, however, shows his martyrdom. He kneels, eyes closed, leaning in resignation against a column as his tormentor saws through his skull. This horrific event is not told in the Book of Isaiah, and is only obliquely referred to in the New Testament. It worked its way from legendary stories of the prophets into the scholarship of the University of Paris, and was taken up by Parisian illuminators in the 13th century, who had to provide thousands of uniform textbooks, chiefly The Bible, to the university community. Because students came from throughout Europe to study theology there, the books they bought in Paris and brought to their lectures and annotated in microscopic, abbreviated script (still visible in the margins of this leaf) had an enormous impact on the design of Bibles. The typical Parisian student Bible is a small, almost pocket-sized book written in two columns, in a minute script on very thin vellum, so that the entire text fits in one volume. These books include not just the Bible text itself, but a number of aids to make the volume easier for students to use and more appealing visually. As we see on this leaf, there is a brief biographical introduction added as a prologue to help the student understand the author of each book of the Bible, a small picture inside the initial to characterize the author, and wedge-shaped guides written in red ink (rubrics) to indicate the start and end of each section.  Features like the larger initials that signal the start of a section and running headers to help students find a particular book (this leaf has “Y-” for the beginning of the prophet’s name and the facing leaf would have supplied the “-SIAS”), were so useful that they are still used in modern book design.  This leaf is small, but it represents one of the most important developments in the history of the Bible as a book.

Schonvvetteri	1648	-	Books	Sevier Collection, QB41 .B92	Vanderbilt University Special Collections	Public Domain	In 1577, Tycho Brahe, the Dane, witnessed a comet. Brahe was one of the last great naked-eye observers of celestial objects and one of the first to understand the necessity of rigorous scheduling and documenting of observations. He also argued that comets were celestial objects and that, therefore, they did not enter the Earth’s atmosphere and so Ptolemy’s theory of the heavens must be flawed.

In it, Galileo published his discovery of four "Medicean Stars" (now known as the Galilean Moons of Jupiter). It also has Galileo's drawings of the moon, previously thought to be perfect and smooth, but now seen to have mountains and plains. Galileo was not the first person to look through a telescope, but he was the first to point one toward the heavens and report on he saw.

G. Schönvvetteri	1901	1573	Books	Sevier Collection, QB41 .B92	Vanderbilt University Special Collections	Public Domain	With the observations in this manuscript, Tycho Brahe refuted the Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm. His precise measurements indicated that "new stars," stellae novae, were not tailless comets in the atmosphere as previously believed, but were above the atmosphere and moon. He also showed that comets were  not atmospheric phenomena and must pass through the supposedly immutable celestial spheres. As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of the Copernican system with the philosophical benefits of the Ptolemaic system into his own model of the universe, the Tychonic system. Furthermore, he was the last of the major naked eye astronomers, working without telescopes for his observations.

Also known as the Seven Sisters or M45, this group of stars is most visible in November when they can be seen from dusk until dawn.  The name probably derives from the Ancient Greek “plein” meaning “to sail” and was an important navigation marker for ancient sea navigation.  The earliest recorded observation of this stellar object is likely the Nebra Sky Disk, a Bronze Age artifact created around 1600 B.C.

He was the first to suggest that meteor showers were composed of debris from comets. He also developed a theory known as Kirkwood’s Gap. This theory asserts that the gaps in the main asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars were caused by the heavier gravitational pull of Jupiter. He alludes to the theory in this letter, stating there are additional Jovian satellites yet to be discovered.

Unlike the American tradition of sending Christmas cards, the French holiday tradition is sending New Year’s cards. Easter cards are prevalent in this group as well, often with displays of floral arrangements. Surprisingly, holiday cards are in fact quite rare among the collection, with just 13 examples in total.

The Hotel Majestic boasted a 30,000 square foot rustic palm garden on the roof with an electrochromatic fountain. Caruso was one of many celebrities who lived at the giant, 600-room hotel overlooking Central Park at 72nd Street after it opened in 1894.

O’Connor would have used a rake such as this to spread seed for her many beloved peacocks. In her 1961 essay “The King of the Birds,” O’Connor notes, “It is hard to tell the truth about this bird. The habits of any peachicken left to himself would hardly be noticeable, but multiplied by forty, they become a situation.” This rake was taken from a scrap metal pile at Andalusia.

In return, I am blessed with their rapid multiplication.” Over the course of her life, O’Connor raised myriad peacocks. She is often depicted aside them, and the peacock feather has come to stand as a symbol of her literary works.

Before the development of steamboats, flatboats were used to bring goods from Nashville to New Orleans via the Cumberland River. By 1819, the General Jackson steamboat had sailed the Cumberland River to Nashville. During the "Steamboat Age" (1811-1830)  steamboats were relied on to transport pork, tobacco, whiskey, cotton and passengers downriver. Railroads would replace steamer commerce in the 1860s as the dominant mode of transportation.

Built by the Red River Line in 1897, it operated on the Red River before moving to the Cumberland and Missouri, finally ending its days in Mobile before capsizing in 1917.  Most steamboats lasted only five years in the hard work of moving supplies and passengers along the river. Electra, built before the addition of locks and dams to help control the Cumberland, would have faced dangerous shoals and snags along the river.

The book is a comprehesive exploration of the 516 miles of the river in Tennessee and Kentucky and contains the names of more than 1200 steamboats which ran supplies and passengers down the river primarily during the Steamboat Age (1811-1830).  While the railroad supplanted steamboats in the 1860s in commercial transportation, a revival of the boats in the 1970s has spawned  a new industry for recreational use.
