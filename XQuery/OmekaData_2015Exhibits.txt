From ancient times until around 1600, the number of identified stars remained at around 1000. But by 1800, scientists had identified over 100,000 stars. American mathematician and astronomer Elijah Burritt published his atlas as a poor man's substitute for a celestial globe. Designed for teaching astronomy, the atlas illustrated stars visible to the naked eye.

The FBI called in a U.S. Department of Agriculture wood expert to compare the ladder to identical wood in Hauptmann's attic.	MSS0412, James G.

A jotted-down license plate on a gold certificate led police to Hauptmann's Bronx residence, where police found $14,000 in ransom money in a shoe box hidden in the garage.

Undeveloped film was found at their hideout in Joplin, Missouri, in 1933 and given to The Joplin Globe which published the images, thus securing their fame as notorious criminals.

Woodson. At one point, he resided at 814 Fatherland Street in what is now called East Nashville. While living in and around the city, Frank worked as a teamster, joined the Methodist Church and had a son with his wife, Annie. Frank lived as a humble citizen for a few years before his brother Jesse convinced him to return to the life of banditry. By the time he left Tennessee to return to Missouri, the legend of the James Brothers was well known.	MSS0412, James G.

One fan described tennis parties as “the highlight of society.” First played in Nahant, MA, in 1874, tennis gained players quickly with 33 clubs in play by 1881. Mary Henderson attended Boston’s Gannett Boarding School for two years after graduating from Knoxville High School.

Paris was the place to study theology in the Middle Ages. This leaf is from a fine Paris Bible that was used by a succession of readers, some of whom added tiny, precisely written notes that have faded to pale tan but are still visible in the margins. This is a correction by a later owner, who supplied a line the original scribe carelessly skipped over.

Metadata/Treasure-Room/Incunabula/Leaf-M-13-AB.xml	[Manuscript Latin Bible, Leaf 13]	Creation: 1290	Incunabula|Bibles	Catholic Church		This leaf from a Bible made in Paris in the mid 13th century has the end of the Prologue to the Old Testament Book of Isaiah and the beginning of the Book of Isaiah itself. The initial V for the opening words of the book, “Visio Isaiae” (“The vision of Isaiah. . .”), introduces the prophet’s long and impassioned rebuke to the people of Israel for their sins. The small scene inside the initial V, however, shows his martyrdom. He kneels, eyes closed, leaning in resignation against a column as his tormentor saws through his skull. This horrific event is not told in the Book of Isaiah, and is only obliquely referred to in the New Testament. It worked its way from legendary stories of the prophets into the scholarship of the University of Paris, and was taken up by Parisian illuminators in the 13th century, who had to provide thousands of uniform textbooks, chiefly The Bible, to the university community. Because students came from throughout Europe to study theology there, the books they bought in Paris and brought to their lectures and annotated in microscopic, abbreviated script (still visible in the margins of this leaf) had an enormous impact on the design of Bibles. The typical Parisian student Bible is a small, almost pocket-sized book written in two columns, in a minute script on very thin vellum, so that the entire text fits in one volume. These books include not just the Bible text itself, but a number of aids to make the volume easier for students to use and more appealing visually. As we see on this leaf, there is a brief biographical introduction added as a prologue to help the student understand the author of each book of the Bible, a small picture inside the initial to characterize the author, and wedge-shaped guides written in red ink (rubrics) to indicate the start and end of each section.  Features like the larger initials that signal the start of a section and running headers to help students find a particular book (this leaf has “Y-” for the beginning of the prophet’s name and the facing leaf would have supplied the “-SIAS”), were so useful that they are still used in modern book design.  This leaf is small, but it represents one of the most important developments in the history of the Bible as a book.

If he did not act, Governor Blanton might have released more murderers and convicts. The country was still reeling from the Watergate scandal, and President Ford’s pardon of Richard Nixon in September 1974 was still fresh in the minds of Americans.

His precise measurements indicated that "new stars," stellae novae, were not tailless comets in the atmosphere as previously believed, but were above the atmosphere and moon. He also showed that comets were  not atmospheric phenomena and must pass through the supposedly immutable celestial spheres. As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of the Copernican system with the philosophical benefits of the Ptolemaic system into his own model of the universe, the Tychonic system.

This theory asserts that the gaps in the main asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars were caused by the heavier gravitational pull of Jupiter. He alludes to the theory in this letter, stating there are additional Jovian satellites yet to be discovered.

Caruso was one of many celebrities who lived at the giant, 600-room hotel overlooking Central Park at 72nd Street after it opened in 1894.

O’Connor would have used a rake such as this to spread seed for her many beloved peacocks. In her 1961 essay “The King of the Birds,” O’Connor notes, “It is hard to tell the truth about this bird. The habits of any peachicken left to himself would hardly be noticeable, but multiplied by forty, they become a situation.” This rake was taken from a scrap metal pile at Andalusia.

(aka Well's Encyclopedia). Esther ran the New York printing company for her husband John, who died during the six-year project. While the map is dated 1810, it is known that Low reused older maps in the publication. This map depicts Kentucky but shows Tennessee as the Southwest Territory, suggesting a date before Tennessee's founding in 1796. Of special interest to this exhibit, notice the way the Cumberland River is drawn. It differs greatly from current day mappings of the Cumberland.	MSS0274, Robert A.

Before the development of steamboats, flatboats were used to bring goods from Nashville to New Orleans via the Cumberland River. By 1819, the General Jackson steamboat had sailed the Cumberland River to Nashville. During the "Steamboat Age" (1811-1830)  steamboats were relied on to transport pork, tobacco, whiskey, cotton and passengers downriver. Railroads would replace steamer commerce in the 1860s as the dominant mode of transportation.	MSS0274, Robert A.

The government has sought to control flooding on the Cumberland for well over a century. Beginning in 1871, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built locks and dams to control river flooding and support the transportation of coal, timber and iron, but flooding has never been eliminated. The most recent flood occurred in May  2010, damaging over $2 billion of private property and causing the death of 26 people.

Before the establishment of the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933,  small private utility concerns like TEPCO were established to generate hydroelectric power as subsidiaries of the Commonweath and Southern. Presidential candidate Wendell Wilkie was president of the C & S and majority holder of most of the private power companies in the Tennessee Valley. TEPCO and 17 other companies sued to prevent TVA from buying up the smaller companies. When the Supreme Court dismissed the case (Tennessee Electric Power Co. v. TVA) in 1939,TVA purchased C & S.

Built by the Red River Line in 1897, it operated on the Red River before moving to the Cumberland and Missouri, finally ending its days in Mobile before capsizing in 1917.  Most steamboats lasted only five years in the hard work of moving supplies and passengers along the river. Electra, built before the addition of locks and dams to help control the Cumberland, would have faced dangerous shoals and snags along the river.

The book is a comprehesive exploration of the 516 miles of the river in Tennessee and Kentucky and contains the names of more than 1200 steamboats which ran supplies and passengers down the river primarily during the Steamboat Age (1811-1830).  While the railroad supplanted steamboats in the 1860s in commercial transportation, a revival of the boats in the 1970s has spawned  a new industry for recreational use.
